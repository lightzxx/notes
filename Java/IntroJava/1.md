* Multithreading enables multiple tasks in a program to be executed concurrently

* A program may consist of many tasks that can run concurrently. A thread is the flow of execution, from beginning to end, of a task.

* The multiple threads share CPU time, known as time sharing, and the operating system is responsible for scheduling and allocating resources to them.

* In Java, each task is an instance of the *Runnable* interface, also called a runnable object.

* A *thread* is essentially an object that facilitates the execution of a task.

```java
String [] letters = new String[] {"a", "b", "c"};
List<String> letterList = Arrays.asList(letters);
```

* The Thread class contains the constructors for creating threads for tasks and the methods for controlling threads.

> **Note** Since the Thread class implements Runnable, you could define a class that extends Thread and implements the run method, and then create an object from the class and invoke its start method in a client program to start thread.

* A **thread pool** can be used to execute tasks efficiently
* Java provides the `Executor` interface for executing tasks in a thread pool and the `ExecutorService`interface for managing and controlling tasks. `ExecutorService` is a subinterface of `Executor`
