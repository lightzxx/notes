* A user story describes functionality that will be valuable to either a user or purchaser of a system or software.
* User stories should be written so that the customer can value them.

* When a story is too large it is sometimes referred to as an epic. Epics can be split into two or more stories of smaller size.

* **Velocity** how much work they'll be able to do per iteration.

## Product Backlog

* **Product Backlog Items** can be technical tasks("*Refactor the Login class to throw an exception*") or more user-centric ("*Allow undo on the setup screen*")
